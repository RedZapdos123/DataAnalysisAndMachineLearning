#This program uses the eXtreme Gradient descent Boosting with robust scaling algorithm to predict the stock prices,
#from it's five days of opening and closing prices, trading volumes and through technical indicators like
#Smiple Moving Averages of last five and ten days and volatility, momentum and price changes of the last day.
